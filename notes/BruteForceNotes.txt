Why Brute Force?
  - It's easy to conceptualize & easy to code!
  - Works for a wide range of problems.
  - Works well for small data set.
  - More Efforts in design may not be justified.
  - it works as a YARDSTICK - always have a simple solution in Bruteforce while comparising to harder problems.
  
  
Why no Brute Force?
  - You'll never get a "Elegent" Algorithm out of it.
