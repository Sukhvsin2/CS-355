Non Recursive Algorithm:
  - Determine Basic Operations
  - Determine The Input Size 
  - Determine Structure at best, worst, avegrage case
  - Determine function that tells how many times the basic operation happens in terms of n
    input size.
  - Determine a asymptotic limit for the grwoth rate of the function in point(4). -> T(n) bounded above g(n).
  
Recursive Algorithm:
  - Count the number of recursive calls * the number of basic operations per recursive call.
